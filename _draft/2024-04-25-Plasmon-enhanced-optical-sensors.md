Due to the nature of light, optical sensors are fast, lightweight, small in size, highly precise,
and they can also be designed as non-destructive sensors for many applications. Surface Plasmon
Resonance (SPR) which exist at the metal/dielectric interfaces become an extensive sensing
implement due to its features for high dependency in dielectric environment, and size, shape
and composition of nanostructures. These various susceptibilities allows for optical sensing to 10
incorporate plasmonic metal nanostructures. Plasmons play different roles in different types
of optical sensors, such as plasmonic sensors, plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) sensors
and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors. This review briefly focuses on the
developments and applications of plasmonic sensors.

Essentially, plasmonics is the science of the interaction of light with metals that involves the study of plasmons, which are quasiparticles representing collective charge density oscillations in the free conduction electron of the metal. Typically, surface plasmons (SPs) refer to the coherent oscillations of conduction electrons on a material surface under the stimulation of quantized energies, i.e., photons, electrons, and phonons. There are two forms of SPs: the localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and the propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are the fundamental elements in plasmonic sensors. LSPR occurs when the dimensions of a metallic nanostructure are less than the wavelength of incident light, leading to collective but non propagating oscillations of surface electrons in the metallic nanostructure. The LSPR strongly depends on the refractive index of the surrounding medium and concentrates the incident electromagnetic EM field around the nanostructure. SPPs are the propagating charge oscillations on the surface of thin metal films. SPPs cannot be excited by free-space radiation, and instead require momentum matching, such as through periodicity in a nanostructure, for resonance excitation. SPPs are modulated by the refractive index of the surrounding medium, transducing the sensorâ€™s signal.

There are different plasmonic resonances which can be determined using the following vector equation. Which is a bit of advanced where the wave vector dependency of epsilon can be noticed which essentially tells us about epsilon can depend on the size of the structure, but this is only applicable when the structures are very small. Otherwise epsilon can simply can determine with only dependency in omega.

$$
k(k \cdot E) - k^2 E = -\epsilon(k,\omega)\frac{\omega^2}{c^2} E
$$

To determine various types of plasmonic resonances, we consider whether the wave is transverse or longitudinal. By longitudinal waves, we essentially mean that wave vector is parallel to the electric field.
