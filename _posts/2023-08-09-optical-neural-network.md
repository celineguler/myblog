While electrons often considered more suitable for information processing (reasons such they are easy to manipulate by E&M fields since they have charge and mass, they do interact unlike photons and you have switching speed since it's easier to stop electrons), ONN offers to find novel ways of information processing and advantages such as high-speed parallelism, low power consumption, and potential for high throughput. Here's an article called [optical-neural-networks-hold-promise-for-image-processing][optical-neural-networks-hold-promise-for-image-processing] about more energy-efficient image sensors.
