title:  "optical neural network"
---

While electrons often considered more suitable for information processing (reasons such they are easy to manipulate by EM fields since they have charge and mass, they do interact unlike photons and you have switching speed since it's easier to stop electrons), ONN offers to find novel ways of information processing and advantages such as high-speed parallelism, low power consumption, and potential for high throughput. Here's an article called [optical-neural-networks-hold-promise-for-image-processing][optical-neural-networks-hold-promise-for-image-processing] about more energy-efficient image sensors.

[CONF-CDS 2020][CONF-CDS 2020] offers inference is the only optically suitable part and not the training. This article [training neural networks with end-to-end optical backpropagation][training neural networks with end-to-end optical backpropagation] focused on this problem (I only read the abstract).

> *"However, to reach the full capacity of an optical neural network it is necessary that
the computing not only for the inference, but also for the training be implemented optically."*

Let's discuss this where the above articles casually lead me to it. But first, I'm gonna try to clarify the concepts of ONN's (optical neural networks), ENN's (electronic neural networks) and ANN's (artificial neural networks) where I only have the sence of ANN's.
