After spending a long miserable time understanding the concept of shorting (it's the opposite of trading) and rewinding Margot Robbie's brutal expotions on it, the big short is still my favorite movie of all time. It's a shitty documentary and a good movie. And it includes Ryan Gosling.

Actually let me tell you more on shorting cause I have a joyful pride with knowing what [it is][shorting]. The basic logic of shorting is the need to evaluate your ability to read the graph backwards and turning your prediction that a security will lose value into cash. Shkreli keeps pointing out the [importance of shorting][shkreli] even though he doesn't favor Michael Burry as an investor. Also here's an [article][yahoo] on Yahoo Finance ranking the best short sellers of all time -- which I can't tell if it makes shorting less important since Shkreli can rank 100 better investors than [Dr. Michael Burry][doctor], where he blavingly represents shorting.
