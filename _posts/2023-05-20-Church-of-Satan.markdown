I needed to come to know all these influential phrases by the Church of Satan. It's LaVeyan Satanism, which rejects the legitimacy of theistic Satanism and embraces a non-dramatic understanding of Satan. "A religious organization" is a jesting way of the devote it's entity but that's just what Wikipedia did.

I was listening to a podcast about the Corspwood Manor, which about a gay couple who murdered brutally in their manors that build by themselves. The interesting character of the story is Dr. Charles Lee Scudder, the homosexual devil worshipper who plays his harp when the full moon comes out and paints his pink winged dog statue as neon. I have to mention that Scudder was brought up with wealthy and educated parents, [is-science-only-for-the-rich-?][is-science-only-for-the-rich-?]. Through the whole case, Joey was the certain victim as being the one who was incapablities, which I don't know if it's making him more divine. Actually there's a site on the internet tells about him and the Corpswood Case more in detail and atrocity, [tragic-case-of-dr-charles-lee-scudder][tragic-case-dr-charles-lee-scudder]. And yes it's unawares me discovering one of the greatest websites existing, [churchofsatan.com][churchofsatan.com].

<br>
To understand Satan from sight of Lavey, I read about Satan's (non-biblical) characteristic and designated views of Satan as I hoped. To be honest, I don't have the pivot to confirm whether the embodiment I'm looking for is entirely consistent with Lavenian satanism. But it's close.

> *in some literary interpretations or alternative perspectives, Satan can be portrayed as a complex figure who understands the human experience and the range of emotions, including sadness. In these interpretations, Satan may view sadness as a tool to manipulate and exploit individuals, exploiting their vulnerabilities or weaknesses for his own purposes.*

<br>
Here's a good quote from the book.

> *"Hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, smash him on the other!"*

<br>
I must mention that Hedonism is an infuential section of the Satanic Bible. The artwork of three pig-heads feasting might be an efficient way to depict Hedonism [image][image]. Lavey shares tons of quotes in the book to encourages individuals to enjoy and savor their desires and pleasures rather than denying them in the name of asceticism or self-denial. Asceticism just makes no sense brother.
