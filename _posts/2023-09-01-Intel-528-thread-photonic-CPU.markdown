title: Intel's 528-thread photonic CPU
---

I must point out that I won't hesitate and feel free to accuse Intel of being premature or being late about this --- and won't mind maturely admiting this was right on time. Why does emphasizing the timing is important? Cause I'm team [Intel][intel].

So Intel displayed their new technology at the Hot Chips 2023 and leave an impression with their detailing on a direct mesh-to-mesh optical fabric and 8-core processor with 66 threads per core. Which sounded unreal for some dramatizers but first let's understand what the hell [mesh][mesh]-to-mesh optical fabric and 8-core processor with 66 threads means.

A "core" refers to a physical processing unit within a CPU --- Basically a smaller CPU or a smaller processor and placed in CPU's which makes them a multicore processesors. A "thread" is a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a core. It represents a basic unit of CPU work. The Apple M1 Pro has 10 core and and it can process 10 threads-per-core which makes Intel's CPU a God --- and not only that: Sun's Niagara 3 (hasn't released yet) will have 16-cores and 16 threads-per-core which still doesn't beat Intel (still no need to dramatize it).
