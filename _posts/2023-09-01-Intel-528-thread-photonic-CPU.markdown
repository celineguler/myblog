title: Intel's 528-thread photonic CPU
---

I must point out that I won’t hesitate and feel free to accuse Intel of being premature or being late about this — and won’t mind maturely admiting this was right on time. I’m team Intel.

I'm surely here to understand the Reddit comments and what is going on with Intel's new processor which made people talk about detecting financial crimes and AI even more dramatically.

So Intel displayed their new technology at the Hot Chips 2023 and leave an impression with their detailing on a direct mesh-to-mesh optical fabric and 8-core processor with 66 threads per core. Which sounded unreal for some dramatizers but first let’s understand what the hell mesh-to-mesh optical fabric and 8-core processor with 66 threads means.

A “core” refers to a physical processing unit within a CPU — Basically a smaller CPU or a smaller processor and placed in CPU’s which makes them a multicore processesors. A “thread” is a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a core. It represents a basic unit of CPU work. The Apple M1 Pro has 10 core and and it can process 10 threads-per-core. Sun’s Niagara 3 (hasn’t arrived yet) will have 16-cores and 16 threads-per-core. Amountly, these technologies doesn’t beat Intel; but more on threads-per-core may mean more. Higher amount of threads can have advantages such as better multitasking, parellelism, hyper-threading and potential downsides such as power and heat or facing non-optimizable sofwares.

Okay, asking some philosophical question, for what is this will be good for? Here are some exiciting news:

* Detect financial crimes such as money laundering

* Identify fraudulent transactions and activities

* Perform influencer analysis in social network communities

* Perform recommendation analysis from customers ratings or purchases.

* Identify weaknesses in power grids, water grids, and transportation networks

* Optimize routes in the airlines, retail, manufacturing industries
