title: Intel's 528-thread photonic CPU

I must point out that I won't hesitate and feel free to accuse Intel of being premature or being late about this, or maturely admit this was right on time. Why does emphasizing the timing is important? Cause I'm team [Intel][intel].

So Intel displayed their new technology at the Hot Chips Symposium and leave an impression with their detailing on a direct mesh-to-mesh optical fabric and 8-core processor with 66 threads per core.
