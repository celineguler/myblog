Test.


why we can't go the the future or the past?
I believe there must be a math existing for that your form of matter cannot leave it's time interval.
the way for you to do that would be exceeding the speed of light.
But assume even that would stump you back to your time interval some how.
m->0
and imagine everything shrinked.
m->(-)
now things start to expand, but oppositely like a mirror.
and that new interval, dt', its like pagination, your speed is higher than c.
