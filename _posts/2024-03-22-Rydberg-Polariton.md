The idea of polariton computing or more accurately polaritons as quantum computers is very exciting in terms of microscale manipulation capasities. In February 2018, scientists had reported the discovery on three-photon form of light, which may involve polaritons, was promising for some useful developments in quantum computing. In this post, my purpose it to understand exciton-polaritons (polaritons), quasiparticles and Rydberg polartion and Rydberg atoms.

Rydberg polartions are unique types of quasi-particles which extended from the strong coupling between photons and Rydberg excitations.
