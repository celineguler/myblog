title: "greed is good"
---

I believe capitalism is pleasent until you admit it or gone to far --- maybe like buying a [drug company][daraprim]. Still mostly agree with Shkreli, and this [article][article], where I gladly met my requests and not making feel bad about it. Sounds selfish, is selfish but also very devine.

Martin Shkreli has faced jail cause of raising the price of a life-saving drug, for his alleged greed for profit. I believe this is a daring enterprise for redefining a new type of service. Not many can deny that it encourages people to discover new ways and expand their understandings on how they should use and support their ownings. It improves beneficial capitalist frames. Freer, more subjective and more creative. It surely does pay attention on developing technologies in teams and how it actually is a problem too. Shkreli brought up a new way of understanding the importance of individuality with a modernist approach, and now his out of jail supporting [e/acc][eacc] and putting his weight on a post-modernist approach, like a real time hero.

I may be associating every problem with the retardation of our poor information processing capacity. We skipped the era where humans were generalists and true geniuses, but here we are cannot even handle specialism. Scientists and engineers working in teams is a problem where we seen to resign our time. Through out all the regulations, nobody seems to pay attention on the consequences by not taking an action on AI and how the hell are we gonna handle such information production. AI is genuinely a problem-solving based technology where it promises great tools and capasities, where we seem to have a delay of realization. This is a bit of an approachable and motivational statement, I also need time to understand how delightfully we neglect the regulations and build the future of AI. Shkreli, suprisingly and not very suprisingly build my understanding of this concept where he's a ex-hedge fund manager and deals with time-series data masterfully --- with AI.
