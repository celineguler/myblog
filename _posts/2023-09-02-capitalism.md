I only know enough about this ideology to be able to talk about California, and as not even being able to say that Trump's rising the taxes are capitalist or not, I believe capitalism is pleasent until you admit it or gone to far --- maybe like buying a [drug company][daraprim]. Still mostly agree with Shkreli, and this [article][article], where I gladly met my requests and not making feel bad about it. Sounds selfish, is selfish but also very devine.

Martin Shkreli faced with jail, where it doesn't make me think that it's because he rised the price of a life-saving drug (which he stated that people who need this drug can easily reach out to it, but not the big markets who buys the drug and sale it for more), but because of where his coming from.

Shkreli's parents where janitors, and I might be wrong, surely, but redefining these type of services in U.S. never faced this roughly with anyone that the way it faced Shkreli. Bankman-Fried case referred as ponzi scheme although it was clearly not. I feel like it's a secret code for government to alarm some evil potential, but Shkreli never accused by ponzi (again, illustrating a ponzi is easy --- calling every case of untaxes cash flow a ponzi is a strategy).
