I believe capitalism is pleasent until you admit it or gone to far --- maybe like buying a [drug company][daraprim]. Still mostly agree with Shkreli, and this [article][article], where I gladly met my requests and not making feel bad about it. Sounds selfish, is selfish but also very devine.

Martin Shkreli has faced jail cause of raising the price of a life-saving drug, for his alleged greed for profit. I believe this is a daring enterprise for redefining a new type of service. Not many can deny that it encourages people to discover new ways and expand their understandings on how they should use and support their portfolio. It improves beneficial capitalist frames --- not the ones like "world peace is not profitable" or "government is good until is bad" but more free, more subjective and more creative frames like "smart people should win, even if they are selfish pricks."

I believe this cases are aligns or spotlights the problem of information overload of today or it's just me aligning every single situtation with this information overload problem and try to spotlight it on my own. In either cases, Shkreli's jail time was a mistake over the calculation incompetence of today's society in cases like this, about __greed__ or what ever you say. Shkreli brought up a new way of understanding the importance of accelerationism (*accelerationism is not a suggestion, it is the solution to information overload that causing humanity to resign its time*) and now his out of jail supporting [e/acc][eacc] and putting his weight on a post-modernist approach, which I think he's not doing it with the awareness of information overload relation with his special case but still a hero to be remembered.

I used the term "information overload" but I'm not simply referring to [this][this] definition which I'm not sure it covers my problem that we're not generating *enough* insights proportional with information. This just associates with the retardation of our poor information processing capacity as humans. Through out all the regulations, nobody seems to pay attention on the consequences by not taking an action on AI and how the hell are we gonna handle such information production in exponentials.

<br>

To clarify my offerings, we are genuiely incapable of doing things and this incompetence is gonna ruin the smoothness of the exponential of our growth in value as humans. Ruining this exponential is a genuine threat against technological singularity, not trying to be dramatic or anything but this could be remembered as a crime in future law, or just the stupidest time period of humans.

AI is genuinely a problem-solving based technology where it promises great tools and capasities, where we seem to have a delay of realization. This is a bit of an approachable and motivational statement, I also need time to understand how delightfully we neglect the regulations and build the future of AI. Shkreli, suprisingly and not very suprisingly helps me forming my understanding of this concept that I may not be appreciating enough.

Here's a more competent blog on [e/acc][eacc], which can express more on effective accelerationism.
