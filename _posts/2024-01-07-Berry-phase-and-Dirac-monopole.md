title: Berry phase and Dirac monopole
---

This is my poor introduction to molecular quantum dynamics. Here's [the article][article] we'll be studying even though it seems to have a lack supporting citations and honestly a proper structure.

We start with the effective Lagrangian for the spin-½ in the magnetic field __B__ = [0, 0, __B__] as,

![formula](/myblog/images/lagrangian.png)

__B__: The magnitude of the magnetic field, along the z-axis.

__θ__: The polar angle, which represents the orientation of the spin with respect to the magnetic field. It is the angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the spin axis.

__ϕ__: The azimuthal angle, which represents the rotation of the spin around the z-axis.

The effective Lagrangian mentioned above is clarified in my Reddit comments quote meaning that it is not a fundamental lagrangian but one that is only applicable and specifically taylored to this problem.
