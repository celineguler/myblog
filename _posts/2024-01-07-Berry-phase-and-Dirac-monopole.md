title: Berry phase and Dirac monopole
---

This is my poor introduction to molecular quantum dynamics. Here's [the article][article] we'll be studying.

<br>

We start with the effective Lagrangian for the spin-1/2 in the magnetic field Bz as,

		
	L(ϕ,ϕ,θ,θ) = ½γBcosθ + i½(1 − cos θ)ϕ
			


__B__: The magnitude of the magnetic field, along the z-axis.

__θ__: The polar angle, which represents the orientation of the spin with respect to the magnetic field. It is the angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the spin axis.

__ϕ__: The time derivative of the azimuthal angle, which represents the rotation of the spin around the z-axis.
