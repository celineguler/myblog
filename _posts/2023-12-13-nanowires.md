title: nanowires

I'll be trying to cover the concept of nanowires, which is a practical example of emergent behavior in physics. Their inherent properties are expected to enable new photodetector architectures for [sensing][1], [imaging][2], memory [storage][3], intrachip [optical communications][4], and other nanoscale applications.

Understanding emergent behavior in physics can be indicated as matter becomes cluster, and it develops new kinds of structures and forms of collective motion, for which its properties are called “emergent.”

My source will be [this][this] article, which is the best resource I've encountered -- maybe cause of I haven't searched for many.
