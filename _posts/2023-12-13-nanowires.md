Understanding emergent behavior in physics can be indicated as matter becomes cluster, and it develops new kinds of structures and forms of collective motion, for which its properties are called “emergent.”

I'll be covering [this][this] article, which is the best resource I've encountered. So I'll be stick with that.

This is a nanowire, which is a practical example of emergent behavior in physics. Their inherent properties are expected to enable new photodetector architectures for sensing, imaging, memory storage, intrachip optical communications, and other nanoscale applications.
