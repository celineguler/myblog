title: Why do colliding blocks compute π?
---

Grant Sanderson tought me about the π Machine, while I was reminding myself that it's never too late to learn 3b1b/manim. π is interesting as always in this concept, but I couldn't come up with anything explanatory --- so I needed to break it down.

The Pi Machine setup looks like this:

We focus on the number of collusions of the second mass, while it pursue it's motion along the 2D path of mass 1 and the wall. And mass 1 is a parameter with powers of 10. Delightfully, powers of 10 matches the digits of number __π__ by number of collisions. So, why? __Why π shows up?__
