This paper covers the analysis of laser profiles since these studies of intensity distribution, laser power, number of modes and laser beam are quite important in many applications. I studied the paper and build up some Python code that can useful for the data management through out the analysis process. Let me break down concepts first but I need mention that I'll be quoting my poorly written report from a century ago. So the concept covering for this post is not bit of a clean-cut.

__INTRODUCTION__

A laser beam is a highly focused and collimated beam of light that is produced by a laser. Laser beam analysis is a set of techniques used to measure and analyze the properties of laser beams. This can include the *beam's intensity, power, shape, and spatial and temporal* characteristics. Laser beam analysis is important in a variety of applications, including manufacturing, scientific research, and military and defense. There are several methods for analysis of a laser beam profile such as __scanning aperture__, __scanning knife-edges__, __detector arrays__, __burn patterns__ and __photographic technique__ which studied in this paper.

__PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS__ 

    Determining the laser source and type of laser beam we are working with. This will determine the appropriate method for analyzing the beam profile. In this paper He-Ne and diode lasers studied that emits pure Gaussian beam and elliptical beam shape, respectively as results concludes.

    Measuring the dimensions of the laser beam. We will need to know the width, height, and length of the beam in order to calculate its properties. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as using a beam profiler or imaging the beam using a camera or other imaging device.

__Beam Diameter__: The beam diameter is the width of the laser beam at a particular point. Using photographic tecnique for a focused beam, using a CCD to capture the spot and fitting it with 2D Gaussian function will be enable to calculate beam diameter of the beam.

$$
D = 2\sqrt{\frac{P}{I \pi}}
$$

$$
I_0 = \frac{2P}{\pi w_0^2}
$$


__D__ is the beam diameter at at a given distance

__P__ is the power of the laser

__I__ is the intensity at a given distance

__Beam Waist__: The beam waist is the point at which the beam has the smallest diameter. The beam waist can be measured using a beam profiler or by performing a series of measurements at different distances from the source to determine the point at which the beam reaches its minimum diameter.


$$
\omega = 2\sqrt{\frac{\lambda z}{\pi}}
$$

$$
D = 2\sqrt(\frac{P}{I_0\pi})
$$

where I₀ is the peak irradiance.


__Rayleigh Range__: The Rayleigh range is a measure of the distance over which a laser beam diverges or spreads out. It is typically expressed in terms of the distance from the beam waist, and is given by the formula:


$$
R = \frac{\pi \omega^2}{\lambda}
$$

$$
R = \frac{\lambda d}{\pi \theta}
$$

    Determine the beam's wavelength and power. These values will be important for calculating the beam's intensity and other properties.__ 1 mW He-Ne laser with 632.8 nm wavelength and 5 mW semiconductor laser with 635.8 nm will be discussed in the following. 

The below graphs shows as the cross-section of laser spot increases the laser power decreases, with the inverse square fitting as figured.

    Measure the beam's intensity distribution. This can be done using a beam profiler of other device that measures the intensity of the beam at various points across it's cross-section.__


Beam intensity can be calculated by the following expression:


$$
I = \frac{P}{\pi(\frac{d}{2})^2}
$$


where:

__I__ is the intensity

__P__ is the power of the laser

__D__ is the given distance

    Calculate the beam's spot size and divergence. These values can be calculated using the beam's intensity distribution and other parameters.__

To calculate the spot size and beam divergence of a laser beam, we will need to know the following information:

__Wavelength__: The wavelength of the laser beam is a key parameter that determines the beam's diffraction behavior.

__Beam diameter at the waist__: The beam diameter at the waist is the diameter of the beam at the point where it is smallest. This can be measured using a beam profiler or by performing a series of measurements at different distances from the source to implement with the given Eq. 3 and Eq. 4.

__Distance from the Waist__:  The distance from the waist is the distance at which you want to calculate the spot size or beam divergence.


<br>

With these information, you can use the following formulas to calculate the spot size and beam divergence:

__Spot Size (diameter)__: Spot size refers to the size of a focused beam of light, or the size of the area illuminated by a beam of light. The spot size can be characterized by its diameter, which is  the distance across the spot at its widest point.

$$
d = \frac{2 \lambda z}{D}
$$

where:

__d__ is the spot size (diameter)

$$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$$ is the wavelength of the laser beam 

__z__ is the distance from the waist

__D__ is the beam diameter at the waist


__Waist Parameter__: The waist parameter, is a parameter that describes the shape of the laser beam. It is defined as the distance from the beam waist to the location where the beam has diverged to a certain size (typically 1/e² times its initial size). The waist parameter is often used to describe the beam quality or "beam profile" of a laser, and it is typically expressed in terms of the wavelength of the laser light. While the beam waist is a specific point in the beam's path, the waist parameter is a property of the beam that describes its overall shape.

$$
\omega₀ = \sqrt\frac{\lambda D}{\pi}
$$

where: 

$$\boldsymbol{\omega₀}$$ is the waist parameter

$$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$$ is the wavelength of the laser beam

__D__ is the beam diameter at the waist


__Beam Divergence (angle)__: Beam divergence is the amount that a beam of light or other type of radiation spreads out as it travels. It is typically measured by the angle between the direction of the beam and the direction in which the radiation is traveling. Factors such as the type of radiation, the size and shape of the emitting aperture, and the refractive index of the material through which the beam is traveling can all affect beam divergence. 

$$\theta = \frac{\lambda}{\pi D}$$

where:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}$$ is the beam divergence (angle) 

$$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$$ is the wavelength of the laser beam 

__D__ is the beam diameter at the waist

In conclusion, the laser beam analysis performed in this report demonstrates the importance of understanding the characteristics and properties of laser beams. The beam quality, power output, stability, and divergence of a laser can all impact its performance and suitability for various applications. By analyzing these parameters, it is possible to optimize the design and use of lasers for different purposes and determine the applications. The results of this analysis provide valuable information for those working with lasers in scientific, industrial, and medical settings.
