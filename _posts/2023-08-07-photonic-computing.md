title:  "Photonic Computing"
---

Photonics is expanding dramatically since the shift need of mainstream electronic where it fails to show higher performance with low power and deal with the exponential growth of in data. Optical communication is appreciated well enough since it provides the internetâ€™s infrastructure, yet still promises more in data processing and data storage. Here's the numbers for required performance capasity.

Electrons:                                  

* Excellent for information processing.    
* Substantial interactions.				   
* High losses.							   

Photons:

* Excellent for communication of information.
* Interacting weakly, only in non-linear media.
* You guessed it.


Photons does not interact strongly as other particles, mostly they can pass through each other easily. Well exceptions exist such as non-linear optical effects, photon-photon scattering (basically two photons interact and scatter off each other due to the exchange of virtual particles like electrons in high-energy enivorments), QED vacuum fluctuations ()

Several challanges come along with optical computing with it's massive paralellism.
IOWN, which I'll talk more on my post [IOWN][IOWN], is on how components of our devices can communicate and interact faster with IOWN 3.0.
