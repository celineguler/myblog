title:  "Photonic Computing"

Photonics is expanding dramatically since the shift need of mainstream electronic where it fails to show higher performance with low power and deal with the exponential growth of in data. Optical communication is appreciated well enough since it provides the internetâ€™s infrastructure, yet still promises more in data processing and data storage. Here's the numbers for required performance capasity.

*Electrons*:                                  

* __Excellent for information processing.__
* __Substantial interactions.__
* __High losses.__							   

*Photons*:

* __Excellent for communication of information.__
* __Interacting weakly, only in non-linear media.__
* __You guessed it__

Photons does not interact strongly as other particles, mostly they can pass through each other easily. Well exceptions exist such as non-linear optical effects, photon-photon scattering (basically two photons interact and scatter off each other due to the exchange of virtual particles like electrons in high-energy enivorments), QED vacuum fluctuations, high photon densities (photon-photon correlations) etc. (or not etc. not sure)




Several challanges come along with optical computing with it's massive paralellism.
IOWN, which I'll talk more on my post [IOWN][IOWN], is on how components of our devices can communicate and interact faster with IOWN 3.0.
