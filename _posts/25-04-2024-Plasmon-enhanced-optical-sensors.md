In this post, focus is how we implement surface plasmon resonance with ultrasensetive detection. Why is it better? How it's implemented? What could be better? will be the topic questions.


The idea of SPR for sensors works (I mean why SPR for sensors)

__PHYSICS OF SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE__

























NOTES:


colorimetric plasmonic sensors
types of plasmon-enchanced optical sensors
