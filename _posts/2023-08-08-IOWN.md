Here's [IOWN][iown]. Innovative Optical and Wireless Network. It basically guides networks and information processing infrastructure and they focus on [Optics][optics].

Not that I have the slightest idea, but photonics doesn't seem to have the potential to completely replace electronics since people denote photonics as an integration to quantum computing, including IOWN, and talk about further that we connect computers using servers we just reach connecting the components inside our computers.
