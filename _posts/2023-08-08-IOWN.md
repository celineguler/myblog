Here's [IOWN][iown]. Innovative Optical and Wireless Network. It basically guides networks and information processing infrastructure and they focus on [Optics][optics].

Not that I have the slightest idea, but photonics doesn't seem to have the potential to completely replace electronics since people denote photonics as an integration to quantum computing, and talk about the farthest point we can go beyond connecting computers using servers is to connect computer components (this is actually not a rough approach, light doesn't acting sanely when you try to manipulate it but with nanophotonics we can agree to disagree).

When we get to the theory of IOWN, it consists of three major technical fields.

* __All-Photonics Network.__
* __Digital Twin Computing.__
* __Cognitive Foundation.__

Well chatgpt is now familiar with IOWN Global Forum and the site has a shitty interface that doesn't make me want to read about. But chatgpt is familiar with the concept of digital twin computing. So basically, a *digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world object, system, or process*. Till this part of the definition I thought what kind of optical system they might want to create a digital form of? *It's created using data from sensors, simulations, and other sources to model the behavior and characteristics of the physical counterpart.* Turned out they are gonna create digital twins using optical systems. I not gonna bothered cutting this part where I am accessing all the info from chatgpt and not even sure if this is the digital twin computing that IOWN hosting. Anyway, let's continue.
