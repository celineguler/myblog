Here's [IOWN][iown]. Innovative Optical and Wireless Network. It basically guides networks and information processing infrastructure and they focus on [Optics][optics].

Not that I have the slightest idea, but photonics doesn't seem to have the potential to completely replace electronics since people denote photonics as an integration to quantum computing, and talk about the farthest point we can go beyond connecting computers using servers is to connect computer components (this is actually not a rough approach, light doesn't acting sanely when you try to manipulate it but with nanophotonics we can agree to disagree).
