Here's [IOWN][iown]. Innovative Optical and Wireless Network. It basically guides networks and information processing infrastructure and they focus on [Optics][optics].

Not that I have the slightest idea, but photonics doesn't seem to have the potential to completely replace electronics since people denote photonics as an integration to quantum computing, and talk about the farthest point we can go beyond connecting computers using servers is to connect computer components (this is actually not a rough approach, light doesn't acting sanely when you try to manipulate it under some further scales, but with nanophotonics we can agree to disagree).

When we get to the theory of IOWN, it consists of three major technical fields.

* __All-Photonics Network__
* __Digital Twin Computing__
* __Cognitive Foundation__

So basically, a *digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world object, system, or process*. Till this part of the definition I thought what kind of optical system they might want to create a digital form of? *It's created using data from sensors, simulations, and other sources to model the behavior and characteristics of the physical counterpart.* Turned out they are gonna create digital twins using optical systems. I not going to act bothered by not cutting this part where I am not even sure if the digital twin computing we're talking about is the one IOWN hosting. Anyway, let's continue.
