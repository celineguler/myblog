__Application areas__





In this post, focus is how we implement surface plasmon resonance with ultrasensetive detection. Why is it better? How it's implemented? What could be better? will be the topic questions. With various plasmon-assisted optical components such as waveguides, color filtering, photon sorters, absorbers, switches etc.
SPR based optical sensors is another important reserach field that has useful applications that we'll discuss in this blog.




SPR is very sensitive and highly dependent in dielectric enviroment (according to this equation) the shift of resonance in optical spectrum can be used to qualify the change of surronding medium. HOW?????????????






The idea of SPR for sensors works (I mean why SPR for sensors)





__PHYSICS OF SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE__

Surface plasmons are coherent free electron excitations that exist at a metal-dielectric interface. Why is a metal dielectric interface essential for the SPR generation? Fundamentally, the sign of the permittivity much change across the interface. That is a condition for the SPR to exist. Metals have a negative permittivity so a metal-dielectric interface gives this condition. 












__PLASMON-ENHANCED SENSING__

The configuration for plasmon enchanced sensing needs to 



__PLASMONIC SENSORS__

we define plasmonic sensors as plasmons acting as the transducer of the sensing signal. (Where does plasmons act upon in sensors? Sensing? Transducer?)


__PLASMON-ENHANCED SENSING__

Plasmonics is used directly for signal transduction.


Key ideas:

__"Plasmons as signal transducers"__

__"Detection of the small changes in wavelength position of localized surface plasmon resonances in metal nanostructures is used of biomarker detection"__

__Nanoresonator dkjf__

__Idea of the sensitivity of SPR and highly dependency on the dielectric environment, the shift of resonance in optical spectrum can be used to quantify the change of surrounding medium: "DETECTION"__
