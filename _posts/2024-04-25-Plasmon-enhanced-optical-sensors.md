In this post, focus is how we implement surface plasmon resonance with ultrasensetive detection. Why is it better? How it's implemented? What could be better? will be the topic questions. Wit various plasmon-assisted optical components such as waveguides, color filtering, photon sorters, absorbers, switches etc.
SPR based optical sensors is another important reserach field that has useful applications that we'll discuss in this blog.

SPR is very sensitive and highly dependent in dielectric enviroment (according to this equation) the shift of resonance in optical spectrum can be used to qualify the change of surronding medium. HOW?????????????




The idea of SPR for sensors works (I mean why SPR for sensors)

__PHYSICS OF SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE__











__PLASMONIC SENSORS__

we define plasmonic sensors as plasmons acting as the transducer of the sensing signal. (Where does plasmons act upon in sensors? Sensing? Transducer?)
