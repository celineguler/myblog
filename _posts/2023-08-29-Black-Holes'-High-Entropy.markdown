This paper covers the analysis of laser profiles since these studies of intensity distribution, laser power, number of modes and laser beam are quite important in many applications. I studied the paper and build up some Python code that can useful for the data management through out the analysis process. Let me break down concepts first but I need mention that I'll be quoting my poor report that I've writen a while ago. So the concept covering for this blog is not very a clean-cut.

> A laser beam is a highly focused and collimated beam of light that is produced by a laser. Laser beam analysis is a set of techniques used to measure and analyze the properties of laser beams. This can include the beam's intensity, power, shape, and spatial and temporal characteristics. Laser beam analysis is important in a variety of applications, including manufacturing, scientific research, and military and defense. There are several methods for analysis of a laser beam profile such as scanning aperture, scanning knife-edges, detector arrays, burn patterns and photographic technique which studied in this paper.
