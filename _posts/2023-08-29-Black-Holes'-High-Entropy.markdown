title: "Black Holes' High Entropy"
---

Just want to point out that I realized my misconceptions about entropy and chaos while trying to ask a simple question about the chaoticity of a system and its limits. What became clear was that when we wanted to question how complex a physical system could be, it is silly to ask about the most chaotic thing in the universe; cause apparently black holes aren't considered "chaotic".

Let me clarify the concepts the best I can with giving some definitions.

Here's *entropy* by [Quora][Quora]:
{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"Entropy is the measure of energy dispersion. The more entropy, the more equally the energy is distributed."*

Here's *chaos* by [Quora][Quora]:
{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"Chaos is a system that exhibits complex dynamics, which is sensitive to initial conditions. Chaotic behavior has a certain order. "*

Here's *entropy* by Google:
{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"A thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system."*

Here's *chaos* by Google:
{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"The property of a complex system whose behaviour is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions."*

Quora highly disagrees that chaos and entropy are not interchangeable. Frankly, I made a generalization because most writers use "on the other hand", "whereas". Google's definitions mostly allign with (I trust Quora more than Google) so we can also say Google agreed the statement. But I don't think this tweet wouldn't agree that Google sorting both terms in the cast of Physics.
