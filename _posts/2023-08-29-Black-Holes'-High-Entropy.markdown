This paper covers the analysis of laser profiles since these studies of intensity distribution, laser power, number of modes and laser beam are quite important in many applications. I studied the paper and build up some Python code that can useful for the data management through out the analysis process. Let me break down concepts first but I need mention that I'll be quoting my poorly written report from a century ago. So the concept covering for this post is not bit of a clean-cut.

A laser beam is a highly focused and collimated beam of light that is produced by a laser. Laser beam analysis is a set of techniques used to measure and analyze the properties of laser beams. This can include the *beam's intensity, power, shape, and spatial and temporal* characteristics. Laser beam analysis is important in a variety of applications, including manufacturing, scientific research, and military and defense. There are several methods for analysis of a laser beam profile such as __scanning aperture__, __scanning knife-edges__, __detector arrays__, __burn patterns__ and __photographic technique__ which studied in this paper.
