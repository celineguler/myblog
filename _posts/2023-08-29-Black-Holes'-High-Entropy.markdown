I realized some of my misconceptions about entropy and chaos while trying to ask a simple question about the chaoticity of a system and its limits. What became clear was that when we wanted to question how complex a physical system could be, it is silly to ask about the most chaotic thing in the universe. Because apparently black holes aren't considered *chaotic*.

Let me clarify the concepts the best I can with giving some definitions.

Here's *entropy*:
{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"Entropy is the measure of energy dispersion. The more entropy, the more equally the energy is distributed."*

Entropy was also discussed by Veritasium as the most misunderstood concept in physics.

{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"A thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system."*

Here's *chaos*:
{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"Chaos is a system that exhibits complex dynamics, which is sensitive to initial conditions. Chaotic behavior has a certain order. "*

{: .italic-gray.indented}
> *"The property of a complex system whose behaviour is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions."*

Quora highly disagrees that chaos and entropy are not interchangeable. Google's definitions mostly allign with Quora so we can also say Google agreed the statements. But doesn't matter since I'm going to clarify how we should sort both terms in the cast of Physics at the end.

You can check [this][chatgpt], my full interview where I poorly try to explore the concepts of *chaos* and *entropy*.	I must mention that the interview ends without satisfiying my question about the *limit for complexity in physical world*. Because this concept, physical complexity, feel inadequate when you think of systems such as the brain or cloud (not complex enough), while complexities such as black holes or space that never fit into a circle while enlarging its diameter make it feel neutral and simplified, actually *not complex* beside math.

As we get to the theory, we can meausure and talk about complexity with the parameters such as amount of components, where we can do such math as having infinite amount of components will give infinite complexity, which doesn't seems to allign with th physical world.

Here are the main criterias that discussed in information theory on complexity:

__Number of Components__: A system with more components (e.g., neurons, particles, elements) can be considered more complex, but this metric doesn't account for interactions and emergent properties.

__Interactions and Connectivity__: The number and nature of interactions among components contribute to complexity. Networks with intricate connections can be more complex.

__Emergent Properties__: Systems that exhibit emergent behaviors, where collective interactions lead to novel phenomena, are often considered more complex.

__Adaptability__: Systems that can adapt to changing environments or evolve over time tend to be more complex.

__Hierarchy and Self-Organization__: Systems with hierarchical organization and self-organizing properties can be considered more complex due to multiple levels of interactions.

In information theory, complexity studied under the context of model selection. Briefly, the complexity is generally measured by counting the number of parameters in the model. When we get to the Shannon's Entropy in model selection and how it related with information complexity
