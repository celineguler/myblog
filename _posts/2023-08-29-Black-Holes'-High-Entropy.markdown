title: "Black Holes' High Entropy"
---

Just want to point out that I realized my misconceptions about entropy and chaos while trying to ask a simple question about the chaoticity of a system and its limits. What became clear was that when we wanted to question how complex a physical system could be, it is silly to ask it in a way it's actually about the most chaotic thing in the universe; cause apparently black holes aren't considered "chaotic".

Let me clarify the concepts the best I can with giving some definitions.
