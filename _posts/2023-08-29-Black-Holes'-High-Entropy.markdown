This paper covers the analysis of laser profiles since these studies of intensity distribution, laser power, number of modes and laser beam are quite important in many applications. I studied the paper and build up some Python code that can useful for the data management through out the analysis process. Let me break down concepts first but I need mention that I'll be quoting my poor report that I've writen a while ago. So the concept covering for this blog is not very a clean-cut.
