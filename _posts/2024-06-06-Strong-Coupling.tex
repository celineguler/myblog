Coupling Harmonic Oscillations are exhibits the two regimes as Strong Coupling and Weak Coupling. These systems (CHOs)	provides an illustration to interplay between energy exchange and dissipation. Identification based on three contexts.

(i) exponential decays or energy exchange cycles

(ii) the steady-state spectrum of
