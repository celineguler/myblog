__DARK MATTER__

Dark matter can be expressed as a proposed cause source based on some observations on expansion of universe. Which didn't turned out to be as expected in 1990's, where it a certain fact that's known about the expansion of the universe, and it seem to be clear that gravity at the end was gonna slow down the expansion. So it was an intuitive understanding to say that the universe had to slow its expansion. But the observations later on show that the universe was actually expanding with an acceleration. Physicist couldn't form this cause, and it remains most part of its unknowns. At that's the reason its called dark matter. It's still a mystery.

The remainings in unknowns part explains why we call it dark, but we can also ask that why do we also classify it as "matter"? We define matter as *anything that takes up space and can be weighed* in the most accepted case, which doesn't tell much if it is a good reasoning or not to identify it as matter. The term "matter" more generally relates with that dark matter also having mass and interactions with gravitional force.

Further than gravitional interactions and having mass, the most important feature that allocates it from normal matter must the that dark matter doesn't interact with light or electromagnetic radiation, which make it unobservable in the common sense. Although it seems to be emerging how we can detect dark matter. Several methods included, generally indirect, such as particle acceleration detection method, absorption, scattering, scinttilating targets. 

__BLACK HOLES__

Black holes are unique physical bodies where you have really strong gravitational pull. More on what that means, a gravitional pull genuiely effects any physical matter on the universe, and in the content of a truly strong pull, you end up with a black hole -- since light is also effected by the impact. As we look for a really strong gravitational force, we end up with massive stars as a source. This is genuiely explains the formation of a black hole. More briefly on that; there's the star formation with a hot core at the center, it starts to occur nuclear fussion reactions which balances the gravitational force with the pressure created and it ends up with disturbing the balance as the nuclear fussion starts to die. The process of the unbalanced forces includes formations of red supergiants (not red giants), supernova and with the formation of the horizon, the black hole.

The black holes are seem to be considered pretty important with their bringings such as how it helped testing the Einstein's theory of general relativity and how it can help more on explaining such rules of the universe.
