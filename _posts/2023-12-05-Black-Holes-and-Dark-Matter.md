__DARK MATTER__

Dark matter can be expressed as a cause source purposed based on some observations on expansion of universe. Which didn't turned out to be as expected in 1990's, where it a certain fact that's known about the expansion of the universe, and it seem to be clear that gravity at the end was gonna slow down the expansion. So it was an intuitive understanding to say that the universe had to slow its expansion. But the observations later on show that the universe was actually expanding with an acceleration. Physicist couldn't form this cause, and it remains most part of its unknowns. At that's the reason its called dark matter. It's still a mystery.

The remainings in unknowns part explains why we call it dark, but we can also ask that why do we also classify it as "matter"? We define matter as *anything that takes up space and can be weighed* in the most accepted case, which doesn't tell much if it is a good reasoning or not to identify it as matter. The term "matter" more generally relates with that dark matter also having mass and interactions with gravitional force.

Further than gravitional interactions and having mass, the most important feature that allocates it from normal matter must the that dark matter doesn't interact with light or electromagnetic radiation, which make it unobservable in the common sense. Although it seems to be emerging how we can detect dark matter. Several methods included such as particle acceleration detection method, absorption, scattering, scinttilating targets. 

__BLACK HOLES__

Black holes are unique physical phenomenas where you have really storng gravitional pull. More on what that means, a gravitional pull genuiely effects any physical matter on the universe, and in the content of a truly strong pull, you end up with a black looking hole - since the light also under the effect.
