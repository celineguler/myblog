title: Black Holes and Dark Matter
---

Dark matter can be expressed as a cause source based on some observations on expansion of universe - which didn't turned out to be as expected. Through out the 1990's, which starts with a certain fact that's known about the expansion of the universe, beside the understandings of that universe might have energy density to stop its expansion or enough energy to lead it to never stop expanding, but it seem to be certain that gravity at the end was gonna slow down the expansion as time moves on. So it was a sensible understanding to say that the universe had to slow its expansion. But the observations later on show that the universe was actually expanding with a *acceleration*. Physicist couldn't form this cause, and it remains most part of its unknowns. At that's the reason its called dark matter. It's still a mystery.

A remainings in unknowns part explains why we call it dark, but we can also ask that why do we also classify it as "matter"? We define matter as *anything that takes up space and can be weighed* in the most accepted case, which doesn't tell much if it is a good reasoning or not to identify it as matter. The term "matter" more generally relates with that dark matter also having mass and interactions with gravitional force.
